# Blast Visualization App

This application displays points that represent really big blasts over the past half century on both map and graph.

As global networks of seismic activity detectors came online (lots and lots of [them](http://www.ncedc.org/anss/anss-catalog-source-codes.html)), they also, not necessarily accidentally, picked up earth shaking explosions as well. The incidents you see here were deemed to be either quarry blasting or nuclear testing. Read all about it at the [Advanced National Seismic Systemâ€™s website](http://www.ncedc.org/anss/anss-detail.html).

You can view the live application [here](http://vannizhang.github.io/blasts-viz-app/).
